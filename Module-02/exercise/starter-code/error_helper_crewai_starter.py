Module 2 Exercise - CrewAI STARTER

Same job as the LangGraph version. One Agent, two Tasks.

    Task 1: explain the error
    Task 2: suggest the fix, using Task 1's answer

Watch for two things while you build it:

  1. You never draw an edge. `Process.sequential` is the control flow.
  2. Task 2 gets Task 1's output through `context=[...]`, not through a
     variable you pass yourself.

Run:
    python error_helper_crewai_starter.py        # sample 1
    python error_helper_crewai_starter.py 2      # sample 2

    #          Then try this experiment, in order:
    #            a) context=[explain_task]  -> task 2 gets task 1. Works.
    #            b) delete the context line -> STILL WORKS. In a sequential
    #               crew, a task with no context= automatically receives
    #               every earlier task's output. CrewAI wired it for you.
    #            c) context=[]              -> now task 2 gets NOTHING, and
    #               the answer falls apart.
    #
    #          So context= is not what turns the hand-off on. It is how you
    #          CONTROL it - how you say "only this task, not everything
